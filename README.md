### Hi there 👋, I'm Weiwei.✨


- 🔭 I'm a boot camp graduate and continute software development learner.
- 🌱 I’m currently sharping my skills on Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, Selenium, Cucumber, and TypeScript. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fun and meaningful projects that improves people's life. 
- 💬 Ask me about how to cook healthy Chinese meal in 15 mins. :P 
- 📫 How to reach me: weiwei.jiang20@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fortune cookie is not from China, you can't find them in China. In fact, fortune cookies might be related to a type of cookie orginally from Japan, called tsujiura senbei (辻占煎餅). I guess Chinese and Japanese probably look the same to American. I sometime can't tell the difference either.
