### Hi there 👋, I'm Weiwei.✨


- 🔭 I just graduated from coding boot camp. Woohoo! Currently working on practicing my learning and looking for a career in the tech world! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, maybe learn react or vue soon. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fun and meaningful projects that improves people's life. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to enter the tech field. 
- 💬 Ask me about how to cook healthy Chinese meal in 15 mins. :P 
- 📫 How to reach me: weiwei.jiang20@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fortune cookie is not from China, you can't find them in China. In fact, fortune cookies might be related to a type of cookie orginally from Japan, called tsujiura senbei (辻占煎餅). I guess Chinese and Japanese probably look the same to American. I sometime can't tell the difference either.
